This data breaks down Kansas occupational wages in terms of the Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media occupation industries. This data was collected from the U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics, the data was released in 2019 and the data was last modified July 6th 2020. The theme of this information is determining industry employment, hourly mean wage and annual mean wage. You might find this information especially interesting if you are in the arts and entertainment industry because it is good information to inquire as a young individual interested in going into the arts and entertainment industry after high school and or college graduation.<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_ks.htm#27-0000"></a>

KStateHD.TV student reporter and production crew member Kelsey Bigelow stresses the importance of being versatile, so you are more eligible to work in any or these many Arts and Entertainment industry occupations.“One thing that has been stressed to me as I continue my journey into journalism and broadcasting is to be versatile. HDTV has given me the opportunity to work in several positions and understand what all goes into a production. I think this knowledge as well as the experiences they have given me will help me in finding a job after graduating college.I actually do worry about that rather often. It’s tough to make a living today and the competition in the journalism world is even higher, especially sports. I think at some point I’m going to have to be willing to take a poor paying job in order to get my foot in the door somewhere and work my way up. It’s just a dose of reality that we will have to face I think.Sometimes you have to give up one thing to get another. I would take a poor paying job at a dream job if it meant a foot in the door to prove myself.”

    <h3>All Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media Industry Occupations</h3>

    
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
In the arts and entertainment industry the occupations can vary anywhere from special effects artists and animators to lighting technicians, media and communication equipment workers. After collecting the data, I analyzed and was able to pinpoint levels of occupation, employment RSE,employment per 1,000 jobs, location quotient, median hourly wage, mean hourly wage, mean annual wage and mean wage RSE. There are a total of 31 industry categories for all occupations and art director occupations. Whereas, it gets narrowed down 5 industry occupation categories when analyzing the broadcast announcers and radio disc jockeys. The 5 categories are; Spectator sports, independent artists, writers, and performers, colleges, universities and professional schools, radio and television broadcasting, employment services.

“In terms of the journalism experience, I think that’s just the main thing, getting experience. Not a lot of employers are going to take a chance on a kid coming straight out of college without any previous experiences in writing, broadcasting, or anything else for that matter. For example, I don’t plan on being a writer but I write articles for the Collegian because it’s good for a resume. Getting experience and sharing that experience I think is the most important thing in my mind. For a lot of people money is a big factor in terms of where or how they work. Myself included. But, I’d rather be happy doing something that doesn’t pay as much rather than do something I hate for 35 years and get paid more but not get to enjoy what I’m doing.  I’d like to make money, but I’m not the type of person that wants a big house or fancy cars or anything so I’m not looking to make a ton. At least not right away straight out of college.” KMAN News Radio audio editor, color commentator/ on-air host, Wildcat 91.9 on-air host and KStateHD.TV production crew member Colin Settle.

When I asked a previous production crew member and student reporter for KStateHD.TV and current employee of KSNT Anna Christianson said about industry wages after graduating college, this is what she had to say.
“... I do think that is kind of the big downside of this industry. There’s very much a barrier of entry, or an attitude that you “have to get through your first contract”. And the pay is bad, the hours suck, but that’s just how... And I really wish it wasn’t that way because I think it causes a lot of young would-be journalists or would-be sms people to turn elsewhere. Not that there’s anything wrong with going to PR or similar, but if you have someone with a dream and they work really hard in school to build a skill set, and then there’s nothing available entry-level that’s more than $26k WITH a college degree, that’s really discouraging.”

        <h4>Data collection and data analysis</h4>
        <p>I collected and analyzed this data by collecting the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically analyzing the occupational employment and wages of 
            individuals in the arts and entertainment industry. In regards to the data analyzed about all occupations and art design in the arts and entertainment industry, that data looks at 
            occupation, employment, location quotient, median hour, mean hourly, annual mean and mean wage. In terms of the data analyzed specifically about broadcast announcers and radio disc jockeys, 
            I focused on the data that demonstrated national estimates, industry profiles and geographic profiles.<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WYB04ut8ronDI8v5YMGK9OErMUb6HFHINtq-6ikYeaQ/edit#gid=472926749"></a>
